I'm a quantitative linguist working in sociolinguistics and phonology.  My research interests and areas of expertise include language variation and change, theories of sound change, accents of English (particularly the Manchester accent and Blackburn accent), ultrasound tongue imaging, laboratory phonology and the intersection between variable processes and phonological interfaces.
